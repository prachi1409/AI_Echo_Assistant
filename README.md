# AI_Echo_Assistant
Echo is an intelligent voice-controlled AI assistant developed using Python. 
The assistant can recognize speech commands, perform automation tasks, and generate smart conversational responses using Large Language Models via Groq API.

It integrates speech recognition, neural text-to-speech synthesis, and AI-based response generation to simulate a real-world virtual assistant.

The system supports interruptible speech, allowing users to stop responses mid-way and interact naturally with the assistant.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of AI integration, voice interaction systems, and automation workflows.
